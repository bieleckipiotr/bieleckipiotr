# 👋 Hi, I'm Piotr Bielecki

I'm an engineer specializing in **Data Science**, with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and programming. I earned my Bachelor's degree in *Data Engineering and Analysis* from **Warsaw University of Technology (Politechnika Warszawska)**, where I'm currently pursuing a Master's in *Data Science*. My key areas of interest are **Finance** and **Medicine**, especially where **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** can bring real-world impact.

🎓 My Master's thesis focuses on:  
**"Implied Volatility Surface Prediction with Machine Learning"**  
This project reflects my passion for **quantitative finance** and cutting-edge modeling techniques.

## 📂 Data Science Portfolio Highlights

Explore my work in the [**Data-Science-Portfolio**](https://github.com/bieleckipiotr/Data-Science-Portfolio) repository. Featured projects include:

- **Big Data Analytics Project**  
  Developed a full-scale big data pipeline for financial and news data. Supports both **batch** and **real-time** processing using **Apache Kafka**, **Spark**, **Hadoop**, **Cassandra**, and **Streamlit**. Includes ML-based price prediction modules and interactive dashboards for visual analysis.

- **Warsaw Public Transport: Data Warehouse & Delay Tracking**  
  Built an **ETL pipeline** and **data warehouse** for tracking bus delays in Warsaw using public APIs. Delivered a **Power BI** report for both **historical analysis** and **potential real-time deployment**, showcasing the integration of API-driven data with static stop metadata.

- **Evolutionary Algorithm for the Circular Cutting Stock Problem**  
  Created a specialized evolutionary algorithm to solve a **cutting stock problem** in circular domains. Implemented custom **crossover** and **mutation** strategies to optimize rectangle placement by value. The project includes visual results and intuitive algorithm descriptions.

Each project is clearly documented and designed to be understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences.
